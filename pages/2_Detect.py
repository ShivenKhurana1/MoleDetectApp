            - If Confidence is 61-80%: You have a high change that the diagnosis is correct. Recommended to check with Dermatologists just to be sure

            If you believe you have Malignant, be sure to check the "Articles" page on the left side of the screen to learn more about the different types of skin cancer, to further educate yourself.
